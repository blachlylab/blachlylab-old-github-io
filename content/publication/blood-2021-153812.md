abstract = "Background: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by clonal expansion of B-lymphocytes that induce secondary immune suppression. CLL is now treated with inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and BCL2. Virtually all patients respond to therapy, however resistance to these therapies has been described justifying the need for novel CLL therapies. Broad inhibition of cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and associated alternative target enzymes with agents such as flavopiridol or dinaciclib have demonstrated significant clinical activity in CLL but are hindered by a relatively narrow therapeutic window. VIP152 is a highly specific inhibitor of CDK9 - considered the most important CDK kinase member for CLL clinical activity. VIP152 has favorable pharmacokinetic properties and has demonstrated durable, preliminary single-agent clinical activity in double-hit diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Herein, we report the efficacy of VIP152 preclinically in CLL."
