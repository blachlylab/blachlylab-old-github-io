absract = "Introduction: Targeted irreversible Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitors ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, have revolutionized treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While BTK inhibition (BTKi) achieves durable responses in 90% of patients, only 10% achieve minimal residual disease (MRD) negative status. MRD positive patients have persistent residual CD5+CD19+ tumor B cells at approximately 1-5 /mm3 in peripheral blood. These cells may represent a subpopulation of B-cell lymphocytosis pre-malignant cells or may carry a BTK C481, PLCG2, or other CLL mutation that is ultimately responsible for disease relapse. Alternatively, MRD could be derived from the original clones present at initial disease presentation that are not dependent on BTK signaling. Readily available clinical DNA sequencing and MRD monitoring techniques lack the ability to characterize these cells adequately due to their rarity in peripheral blood. To address this problem, we developed a novel method for limited-cells using fluorescence activated cell sorting in tandem with next generation sequencing (LC-FACSeq) to characterize rare tumor subpopulations in the blood and bone marrow. LC-FACSeq may be useful not only for CLL but also other leukemias."
