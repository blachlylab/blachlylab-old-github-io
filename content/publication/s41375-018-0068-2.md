abstract = "Thus far, only 5–15% of AML patients aged ≥60 years are cured with chemotherapy. Identification of patients who are less (more) likely to respond to standard chemotherapy might enable early risk stratification toward alternative treatment regimens. We used a next-generation sequencing panel of 80 cancer- and/or leukemia-associated genes to profile molecularly 423 older patients with de novo AML. Using variables identified in multivariable models and co-occurring mutations in NPM1-mutated AML, we classified the patients into good-, intermediate- and poor-risk groups for complete remission (CR) attainment, disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Whereas 81% of good-risk patients (comprising NPM1-mutated patients harboring mutations in chromatin remodeling, cohesin complex, methylation-related, spliceosome, and/or RAS pathway genes, FLT3-TKD, and/or patients without FLT3-ITD) achieved a CR, only 32% of poor-risk patients (with U2AF1, WT1 mutations and/or complex karyotype) did. Intermediate-risk patients had a 50% CR rate. Similarly, using NPM1 co-mutation patterns and SF1 mutation status, we identified patients with favorable DFS and OS 3-year rates of 46% and 45%, respectively. Patients with adverse genetic features had DFS and OS rates of only 2% and 4%. We show that application of our proposed criteria may refine the 2017 European LeukemiaNet classification for older patients treated with chemotherapy."
