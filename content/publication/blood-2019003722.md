abstract = "Lucas et al explored the clonal dynamics of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients following treatment and subsequent acquired resistance to ibrutinib and then venetoclax. They report different patterns of resistance mutations from previously reported changes following venetoclax treatment in the absence of prior BTK inhibitor therapy."
