abstract = "Rare, recurrent balanced translocations occur in a variety of cancers but are often not functionally interrogated. Balanced translocations with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH; 14q32) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are infrequent but have led to the discovery of pathogenic genes including CCND1, BCL2, and BCL3. Following identification of a t(X;14)(q28;q32) translocation that placed the mature T cell proliferation 1 gene (MTCP1) adjacent to the immunoglobulin locus in a CLL patient, we hypothesized that this gene may have previously unrecognized importance. Indeed, here we report overexpression of human MTCP1 restricted to the B cell compartment in mice produces a clonal CD5+/CD19+ leukemia recapitulating the major characteristics of human CLL and demonstrates favorable response to therapeutic intervention with ibrutinib. We reinforce the importance of genetic interrogation of rare, recurrent balanced translocations to identify cancer driving genes via the story of MTCP1 as a contributor to CLL pathogenesis."
