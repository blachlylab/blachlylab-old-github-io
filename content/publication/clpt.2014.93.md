abstract = "Prospective studies on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in African Americans with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not previously been performed. In this phase II randomized study, 55 African Americans with NSCLC received 150mg/day erlotinib or a body weight–adjusted dose with subsequent escalations to the maximum-allowable dose, 200mg/day, to achieve rash. Erlotinib and OSI-420 exposures were lower than those observed in previous studies, consistent with CYP3A pharmacogenetics implying higher metabolic activity. Tumor genetics showed only two EGFR mutations, EGFR amplification in 17/47 samples, eight KRAS mutations, and five EML4-ALK translocations. Although absence of rash was associated with shorter time to progression (TTP), disease-control rate, TTP, and 1-year survival were not different between the two dose groups, indicating the dose-to-rash strategy failed to increase clinical benefit. Low incidence of toxicity and low erlotinib exposure suggest standardized and maximum-allowable dosing may be suboptimal in African Americans."
