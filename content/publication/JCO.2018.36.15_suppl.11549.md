abstract = "Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) describe a heterogeneous group of tumors with limited treatment options available to patients. Targeted therapy exists for tumors with alterations in BRCA1/2 as well as other homologous recombination (HR) pathway genes; however, their prevalence has yet to be fully described in STS. We hypothesized that tumors with these alterations may represent a targetable cohort with the advent of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Here we assess the frequency of BRCA1/2 and HR alterations in STS. Methods: DNA sequencing data was aggregated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 255), Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (n = 583), and The Ohio State Sarcoma Registry (n = 398). Deleterious genomic alterations were defined as in ClinGen. Clinical data from three patients with somatic BRCA2 loss who were treated with PARP inhibitors were collected for analysis. Results: BRCA1 and HR somatic alterations were more common in leiomyosarcoma (LMS) subtype compared to other STS (LMS 17%, liposarcoma 9.8%, other 8.9%, p = 0.001). A disproportionate number of BRCA2 losses were detected in uterine LMS (uLMS) with 85.7% of tumors harboring BRCA2 loss identified in this STS subtype (p < 0.001). When considering uLMS, 9.8% of tumors had a loss of BRCA2 (0.9% in non-uterine LMS, 0.5% in all other STS). Tumors with BRCA2 loss often exhibited a poor differentiated histology (57.1% of BRCA2 loss vs 38.8% BRCA2 intact; p = 0.59) and tended to have a higher mitotic count (10.7 count/HPF BRCA2 loss vs 3.3 count/HPF BRCA2 intact; p = 0.10). Retrospective evaluation of three uLMS patients with somatic BRCA2 loss treated with PARP inhibitors demonstrated a median progression-free survival of nine months highlighting the potential targetability of BRCA2 loss in uLMS. Conclusions: Here we assess the frequency of BRCA1/2 and HR alterations and their clinical phenotype in STS. We identify somatic BRCA2 loss in a subset of patients with uLMS and describe three patients with uLMS harboring BRCA2 loss who were treated with PARP inhibitors. Our data suggests that patients with uLMS should be screened for BRCA2 alterations. Prospective trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of PARP inhibition in this cohort of patients."
