abstract = "Chromosomal aberrations and multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have established a major hematopoietic quantitative trait locus in chromosome 6q23.3. The locus comprises an active enhancer region, in which some of the associated SNPs alter transcription factor binding. We now identify miR-3662 as a new functional driver contributing to the associated phenotypes. The GWAS SNPs are strongly associated with higher miR-3662 expression. Genome editing of rs66650371, a three-base-pair deletion, suggests a functional link between the SNP genotype and the abundance of miR-3662. Increasing miR-3662’s abundance increases colony formation in hematopoietic progenitor cells, particularly the erythroid lineage. In contrast, miR-3662 is not expressed in acute myeloid leukemia cells, and its overexpression has potent antileukemic effects in vitro and in vivo . Mechanistically, miR-3662 directly targets NF-κB–mediated transcription. Thus, miR3662 is a new player of the hematopoietic 6q23.3 locus. "
