Dr. Blachly is an oncologist focused on the treatment of patients diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He’s a member of the Leukemia Research Program at the OSUCCC – James and serve as an assistant professor in The Ohio State University Division of Hematology. As a member of the Leukemia Research Program at the OSUCCC – James, his research interest is in genomics and gene transcription in leukemia and its relevance in experimental therapeutics. His work explores whether and how mutations and transcriptional attributes can be studied in the context of clinical trials to provide prognostic and predictive information relevant to novel anticancer therapies. He was recently named as one of six recipients of a Young Investigator Award from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Foundation. He received a six-figure grant for a project titled “Genomic Stratification and Prognostication of Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia by Combination Mutation Status. He loves the collaborative spirit at OSUCCC – James and how we all share the common purpose of providing optimal and effective care and treatment for patients –– and the goal of one day living in a world free of cancer.
