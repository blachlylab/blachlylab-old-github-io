Thomas is a bioinformatician / computational biologist with 4 years of experience creating novel algorithms for the analysis of NGS data as well as the creation and maintenance of various NGS analysis pipelines. 
He currently have experience in various programming languages: python, R, D, Rust, Go, Java, and JavaScript; he has also worked on a variety of projects: development of a variant caller, AWS hosted real-time data analysis of NGS data, development of new analysis pipelines for novel laboratory protocols, transformation of VCF variant data into spreadsheets for clinical staff. 
Thomas discovered and described a sequencing artifact originating from physically deranged molecules in next-generation sequencing libraries and provide software to filter these artifacts.
He also has experience in a Linux server environment with a slurm job manager and using R / ggplot2 and Adobe illustrator to create plots and graphics for academic publication.
