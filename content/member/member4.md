Kathryn earned a B.S in bioinformatics and computational biology from Iowa State University and a Master’s of Applied Bioinformatics at Cranfield University, Cranfield, UK. She was an undergraduate researcher for four years working on analysis of genomics and population architecture of maize and teosinte developing expertise in genetics, bioinformatics, and field work. In 2016, she received the Iowa State Emerging Leadership Award and actively volunteered as a Speaker’s Bureau panelist and helped with event planning / fundraising, while completing her undergraduate. When free, she enjoys martial arts, chess, amateur archaeology, and bush camping.
